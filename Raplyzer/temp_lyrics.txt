The rest is empty with no brain but the clever nerd.
The best MC with no chain ya ever heard.
Take it from the TEC 9 holder.
They've bit but don't know their neck shine from Shinola.
It's the MC with the jewels on the necklace.
.
Who stepped in the door with the game on?.
Not the King but the God with the microphone.
Now the kingpin has arrived.
Who walked in the door with the game on?.
.
Ayo it was the return of the hard rock group.
With hits that you never heard before.
They formed a vocal and that's what they said.
To break the mold they tried to break the boards.
And break boards cause when they play they sound.
So it's no matter what it's simply a matter of time.
When the rhyme they make so swift they make they heads explode.
So remember they're always known as the kingpin.
I'ma go out like this until the day I be.
Real MC with no chain ya ever heard.
.
Yeah I had a message to the MC you can call it a free lunch.
The last MC with a chain left him standing in the cut.
But the kingpin has arrived.
I didn't think he was coming out tonight.
I just kept chilling chilling chilling with the beat.
Now I wanna make a right turn right right wrong.
Cause right now right in the house.
Right by the house right by the porch.
Right in the house right in the house.
